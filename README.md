# CelsiaNet2024
A Multimodal Vision Language Model Framework--St. Yau 2024 Finalist Bronze Award

The technological term "Celsia" or "CELSIA" stands for Computer-vision Enhanced Lightweight System for Integrated modAlities". The Celsia series tends to try to accomplish lightweight but high precision and accurate information determination for a multi-modal framework. This serves to be a part of allowing smaller model-sized AGI networks to operate without lagging and while maintaining high precision. 

CelsiaNet is a specific Network under the Celsia project's aim that targets improving the accuracy and precision while decreasing the model size of the Vision Language Models. 

In this project, we have taken inspiration from the papers BLIP2, LLaVa, ControlCap, DynRefer, and Unicom to forge an interconnected training process for the basis of CelsiaNet.
